#### Database Table Synchronization Script

**Overview**

The purpose of this script is to synchronize the Sequelize models with the database, ensuring the database schema matches the defined models. This process involves dropping all existing tables and then recreating them, which is particularly useful for resetting the database state during development or testing.

**Key Functionalities**

* **Table Synchronization**: Uses Sequelize's `sync` method to align database tables with model definitions.
* **Forced Recreation**: Employs the `{ force: true }` option to drop existing tables before creating new ones, ensuring a fresh start.
* **Feedback Mechanism**: Logs the outcome of the operation, providing immediate feedback on the success or failure of the table synchronization.

**Implementation Details**

1.  **Import Sequelize Models**:

    * The script starts by importing the Sequelize models object, which encompasses the Sequelize instance and all defined models.

    ```javascript
    const db = require("../models"); // Adjust the path based on your project structure.
    ```
2.  **Define and Declare Tables**:

    * The `defineTables` async function orchestrates the synchronization process, dropping and recreating tables based on the models.

    ```javascript
    async function defineTables() {
        try {
            await db.sequelize.sync({ force: true });
            console.log("Tables have been defined and declared successfully.");
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error defining tables:", error);
        }
    }
    ```
3.  **Executing the Script**:

    * The function is called to initiate the table synchronization process. The console logs provide feedback on the operation's success or any encountered errors.

    ```javascript
    defineTables();
    ```
